# module-one-challenge

### Introduction

This is the challenge assignment for Module One. The CSS code has been labeled, and the website
is now much more accessable than it was. I also redesigned the website to be more responsive when viewed on a mobile device.

### Requirements

You don't need anything else outside of the GitHub Repository to make this site work.

### Installation

Here is the link to the GitHub repository where you can download all the required files:
https://github.com/Sercanbrack/module-one-challenge

### Configuration

Everything should come preconfigured and work as intended.
